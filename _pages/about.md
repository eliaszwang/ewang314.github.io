I am a PhD candidate in Electrical Engineering at Stanford, working with Prof. Dan Yamins in the [NeuroAI Lab](https://neuroailab.stanford.edu/). I am broadly interested in the areas of intelligence, computation, and neuroscience. Specifically, the goal is to reverse engineer the mind in order to elucidate the fundamental principles that underlie intelligence, with the hope of building more flexible and robust machines as well as developing a better understanding of how the brain works.

Before Stanford, I worked at Princeton for a summer in Prof. Sebastian Seung's lab on connectomics research. At Cornell I worked in Prof. Melissa Warden's lab studying the neural circuits that mediate reward and motivation. During the summer of 2015, I worked in Prof. Loren Frank's lab at UCSF as an Amgen Scholar. Before transferring to Cornell, I studied ECE and Math at Rutgers University. While there, I was fortunate enough to have worked with Prof. David Margolis, Prof. Ivan Marsic, and Prof. Gary Merrill.
