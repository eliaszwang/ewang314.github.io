Humans have a remarkable capacity to understand the physical dynamics of objects
in their environment, flexibly capturing complex structures and interactions at
multiple levels of detail. Inspired by this ability, we propose a hierarchical particle-
based object representation that covers a wide variety of types of three-dimensional
objects, including both arbitrary rigid geometrical shapes and deformable materi-
als.  We then describe the Hierarchical Relation Network (HRN), an end-to-end
differentiable neural network based on hierarchical graph convolution, that learns
to predict physical dynamics in this representation.  Compared to other neural
network baselines, the HRN accurately handles complex collisions and nonrigid
deformations, generating plausible dynamics predictions at long time scales in
novel settings, and scaling to large scene configurations. These results demonstrate
an architecture with the potential to form the basis of next-generation physics
predictors for use in computer vision, robotics, and quantitative cognitive science.
